## Message Encryption With Public & Private Keys Using RSA
You can encrypt and decrypt messages with public & private keys using RSA.
Since it's an asymmetric encryption, it is very secure and common.
I've simplified it with an example. You can check `example.py` file to see how it works.

## Requirements
- You can see all the required libraries in `requirements.txt` file. You can install them all at once via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
